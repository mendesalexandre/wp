## Developing

* All code must be related to an issue in the current milestone
* Commits should be small and contain one thing
* Commits should be in a feature branch
* Once you have reviewed and tested your own code and happy for it to be reviewed
* Open a pull request to merge your feature branch (e.g. connect-button-bug) into the develop branch
* Tag the PR with the appropriate milestone
* Add "Resolves #{issue}" to the pull request description (this will link it to the related issue and also automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged)
* Tag it `ready` and either @polevaultweb or @kjohnson will review
* A pull request may be sent back back to the original developer for additional changes. If this happens, go ahead and make the required changes and reapply the "ready" label once you've ready for another round of code review
